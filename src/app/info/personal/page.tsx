          I firmly believe that technology has the power to effectively influence everyone's life for the better. Technology and collaboration go hand in hand, and that's precisely what I strive to bring wherever I go.

          I hope that together we can contribute to building a better world!

          I was born in 1989 in the small city of Mogi das Cruzes, SÃ£o Paulo. Growing up in the late '80s, I have always been a very curious individual, particularly about technology. Around the age of 8 or 9, my family acquired our first computer, a Pentium 133.

          This was a significant change in my life; it was the moment I discovered the world. Soon after, I eagerly sought to learn even more. At the age of 11, I enrolled in my first computer course, covering topics such as the Microsoft Office suite, typing skills, and web usage.

          My first foray into web development was with FrontPage, where websites were constructed as large tables in the early versions. Essentially, a page was a table within a table within a table.

          I spent weekends delving into the source codes of websites, striving to comprehend how I could create my own projects. As a result, the desire to learn more and more became insatiable. The next step was a course focused specifically on Web Design, where I gained exposure to the early versions of Photoshop, Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver, and other tools.

          I delved deeper into understanding how protocols and the then-nascent, scarcely explored realm of high-speed internet were shaping up in the early 2000s.
